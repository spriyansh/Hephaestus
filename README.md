# Hephaestus
__Shiny Platform for Micro-array data analysis__

### Description


### Motivation
Hephaestus is the Greek god of blacksmiths, metalworking, carpenters, craftsmen, artisans, sculptors, and metallurgy. He served as the blacksmith of the gods and was worshipped in the manufacturing and industrial centres of Greece. Hephaestus crafted much of the magnificent equipment of the gods. Inspired by the name and _Hephaestus_ is a shiny based application specifically designed for the analysis of micro-array based data. It has been noticed that non-programmers face a broad array of challenges when it comes to data analysis and visualisations. To bridge the gap between the data scientists and biotechnologists, I present “Hephaestus” which is an end-to-end microarray data analysis tool developed with the power of shiny.


### Salient Features
- It fetches the datasets directly from the __Gene Expression Omnibus__ with a few clicks.
- It can be used to make publication-ready plots like Volcanos, Heatmaps, correlation networks and MDs.
- Additionally, a user can run differential expression pipelines using R’s limma library.
- Hephaestus runs on all the major data formats like CSV, TSV, MS Excel (.docx).
